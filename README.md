Canadian Common CV Tweak
========================

## What is it?

The Canadian Common CV Tweak is a small script you install in your browser,
and which modifies the layout and text size of the Canadian Common CV's web
site to make it more usable (or rather, usable at all).

[Install the script](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/7940-canadian-common-cv-tweak/code/Canadian%20Common%20CV%20Tweak.user.js)
on Greasy Fork

## Why?

Researchers in Canada must now use the [Canadian Common
CV](https://ccv-cvc.ca/) as a centralized online repository for storing
information about their career (publications, courses taught, funding,
students supervised, etc.). The CV's web interface has been criticized for
its low usability. One major problem is that the usable area in many
sections is confined to a tiny rectangle that cannot be enlarged, no matter
how big is your browser's window:

<a href="http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/sylvainhalle/media/ccv-papers-before_zpsi0ncaf1n.png.html"><img src="http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/sylvainhalle/ccv-papers-before_zpsi0ncaf1n.png" width="400" /></a>

Most of the time, the information in that rectangle is a table where most
of the lines and most of the columns are not visible without scrolling far
away --it feels like reading a phone book through a pin hole.

The CCV Tweak modifies the layout to make the previous page look like this:

The script works in:

- **Firefox**: install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey) first
- **Chrome**: install [the Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) first
- **Opera**: install [Violent Monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey) or [Tampermonkey](http://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta) first
- **Safari**: install the [NinjaKit](http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz) extension first. Make sure that extensions are enabled in the settings, download the file and double click it. Then you can install the script.
